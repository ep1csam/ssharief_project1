        <h3>Brief Introduction:</h3>
        Inquisitive, detail-oriented graduate student seeking opportunities in the fields of Data Science, AI,
and Security. Equipped with the proper technical skills and ability to multitask in fast-paced environments.

        <h3>Values And Beliefs:</h3>
        I believe that the ability to invent, innovate and discover is what has propelled man to the echelons of
success. Throughout my life, I have been driven by the desire to 'create', a capability that transcends the
passive acquisition of knowledge. It is always the unknown path that has enthralled me more than known
terrain. In a world where everything from fighter jets to elevators, interactive graphic displays to digital
watches, is driven by computers, I found it difficult not to get fascinated by the technology involved.

        <h3>Career Aspirations:</h3>
        The attraction of programming for me lies in its breadth of applicability, both as a method of problem solving
in itself and in a symbiotic integration with other areas of computer science. A broad spectrum of
applications exists within its field, ranging from small software applications to a ubiquitous computing
solution that intelligently reacts to a variety of users. This diversity is one of the main reasons that I feel
compelled to pursue computer science further. 
I look forward to meeting students from diverse background so as to develop into a true global researcher. I
believe after completing my degree I will be equipped to establish a career in computer science at the
most competitive level, and enter the workforce with confidence, ready to complete the daily
responsibilities required of a professional CS Engineer.

        <h3>Interests and Hobbies:</h3>
        I am very passionate about writing code and then debugging it. I remember waiting patiently in the computer lab, staring for what seemed to be hours at a computer screen
running lines of codes I had written. I was working on debugging my code before I could go home for the
day, but it was obvious seeing the amount of bugs that I would get home late that day. I realized then
that programming was not as easy as it seemed and as someone who loves solving problems, I fell in
love with writing code that worked flawlessly. 
Apart from that, I love reading novels. The longer the novel, the better. I remember that I would complete reading the storybooks I got from the library on the way to home and always regret not buying longer ones.
