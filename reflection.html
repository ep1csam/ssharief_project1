            When I first stepped foot into the United States, having left behind all of my family and friends, I felt apprehensive 
            of what was in store for me. The first few weeks were spent adjusting to the new atmosphere and battling 
            homesickness. However, now that close to a year has passed by, I look back only to find myself smiling
             at all the memories I've made. Living alone has helped me mature and become responsible for not only myself, but for 
             others around me. It has taught me the value of friends and family and how to cherish them. I feel that only by 
             experiencing new things, can a person truly grow up. This past year, I have tried to 
             experience as many new things as I could and worked towards becoming the 
             best version of myself and I am truly happy at what I have already achieved. I eagerly look forward to what new experiences 
             await me in the future.
