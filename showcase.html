                <b><h3>Projects</h3></b>
            <b> Fake OSN (Online Social Network) Profile Detector Using Artificial Neural Networks</b><br>
• Utilized deep neural networks to discover fake profiles on social media sites.<br>
• Made use of exploratory data analysis, data visualization and deep learning model training to analyze
whether a profile was legitimate or not.<br>
• Project was implemented in Python and made use of modules such as TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn and Pandas to name a few.<br>
<br><b>QR Code Based Attendance System on Android<br></b>
• Created an efficient QR-based Android application for attendance management system designed to track
a student's activity in the class using Android Studio.<br>
• The application takes attendance electronically and stores it in a database.<br>
• Insertions, deletions, and changes of data in the system can be done in a straightforward manner via the
designed GUI without interacting with the tables.<br><br>
<b>Web Scraper News Website<br></b>
• Use a web scraper to mine information from multiple news sources based on a keyword given by the user
which is matched with the headers and title of various news feeds.<br>
• The project was implemented in Python by using Selenium Web Driver, Beautiful Soup and Pandas on
Google Collabs.<br><br>
<b>IoT based vehicle tracker<br></b>
• Interfacing a GPS module with a NodeMCU to create a simple local web server on which the location
details would be uploaded to.<br>
• This enables a user to check the location in Google Maps by clicking on the link created using the
coordinates from the NodeMCU and globally by activating port forwarding in your modem/router.<br>

           <br> <b><h3>Experience</h3></b>
            <b>Research Assistant – With Dr. Nawaz Ali, Dr. Suruz Miah and Dr. Nazmus Sadat</b> <br>
<i>Performance Analysis of 5G New Radio V2X Communication</i> <br>
• Develop and analyze the performance of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)’s New Radio (NR)
system for the Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. <br>
• Compare different communication protocols such LTE-V, DSRC and NR-V2X and use simulations in NS-3 to test
a hybrid vehicular communication system on a Linux Virtual Machine. <br> <br>
<b>Group Research Assistant – With Dr. Christos Nikolopoulos </b><br>
<i>Data Warehousing</i> <br>
• Gathered data from various APIs regarding various basketball team statistics. <br>
• Created a database and GUI and applied machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of games. <br> <br>
<b>Assistant Teacher – With Dr. Jacqueline Henderson</b> <br>
<i>In-person aide for the DAPCEP STEM program held in Bradley University </i><br>
• Intended to make sure that local 5th- 8th grade students continued to engage in STEM related fields. <br>
• Assisted the professor in clearing student doubts, taking and grading tests as well as taking the class when the
professor was unavailable. <br>
• Part of the Life of Pi (Python) program assisting Mr. Jerod Lockhart.
